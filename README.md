## Requirements

* Git
* Ruby 2.4.x
* Bundler 1.15.x


## Usage

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rhannequin/mon-petit-taille-3
$ cd mon-petit-taille-3
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rails fork[/home/xxx/my-new-project]
```

Where `/home/xxx/my-new-project` is where you want to create your project.

Names like `my-new-project` will create a module like `MyNewProject`.

**Warning:** if you are using [ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), you have to use another syntax:

`$ bundle exec rails fork\[/home/xxx/my-new-project\]` or

`$ noglob bundle exec rails fork[/home/xxx/my-new-project]`.


## Testing

```
$ RACK_ENV=test bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate
$ bundle exec rspec
```

## Features

### Environment variables

All environment variables are defined in [application.yml](https://github.com/rhannequin/mon-petit-taille-3/blob/master/config/application.yml) and used by the [Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) gem. Some of them are required by the application to be started and are defined in [figaro.rb](https://github.com/rhannequin/mon-petit-taille-3/blob/master/config/initializers/figaro.rb)

### User model

#### UUID

Users are not using regular integer ids, but UUID generated by PostgreSQL's uuid_generate_v4(). This is why PG is required on this project.

#### `#name`

Each user has a required `#name` attribute which is unique and leads to create a [friendly_id](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id) slug.

### Devise

#### Password pepper

Devise is [configured](https://github.com/rhannequin/mon-petit-taille-3/blob/master/config/initializers/devise.rb) to use a pepper hash to generate hashed passwords.

#### Password change

Devise will send an email to user when they change their password.

#### Lockable module

Devise's [Lockable](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/plataformatec/devise/master/Devise/Models/Lockable) module is enabled. It is [configured](https://github.com/rhannequin/mon-petit-taille-3/blob/master/config/initializers/devise.rb) lock user's account and send unlock instructions by email after 10 failed sign in.

### Views

Views are generated from Haml files and not ERB.

### I18n

Everything (almost) is supported in English and French.

### Rack::Attack

Rack middleware for blocking & throttling abusive requests. Use the default [configuration](https://github.com/rhannequin/mon-petit-taille-3/blob/master/config/initializers/rack-attack.rb).
